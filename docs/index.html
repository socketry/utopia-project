	<h1>Utopia::Project</h1><main><p>A simple Ruby project documentation website.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>I've used many documentation tools. Most are over-complicated and focus on what is possible rather than what is useful. Because I manage many open source projects, at a certain scale it makes sense to build something to suit your needs rather than try to adapt to existing systems. This is one such instance.</p>
<p>My goal is to provide task-centric documentation, and to continually improve the way it's presented. The primary entry point for new developers are the structured usage guides, however having rich cross-referencing into the code is equally important.</p>
<p>With that in mind, this web application provides such a model and will evolve over time to suit my requirements and the needs of my users.</p>
