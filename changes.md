### Improve `changes.md` document organization

Previously, level 1 headings were considered releases. This was changed to level 2 headings to allow for a level 1 heading to be used as the title of the document.

## v0.28.0

### Introduce `changes.md` document

A new changes document, if present, will be used to display changes in the release notes. The changes document should be named `changes.md` and should be placed in the root of the project. The changes document should be written in markdown format.
