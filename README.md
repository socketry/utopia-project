# Utopia::Project

A simple Ruby project documentation website.

[![Development Status](https://github.com/socketry/utopia-project/workflows/Development/badge.svg)](https://github.com/socketry/utopia-project/actions?workflow=Development)

## Motivation

I've used many documentation tools. Most are over-complicated and focus on what is possible rather than what is useful. Because I manage many open source projects, at a certain scale it makes sense to build something to suit your needs rather than try to adapt to existing systems. This is one such instance.

My goal is to provide task-centric documentation, and to continually improve the way it's presented. The primary entry point for new developers are the structured usage guides, however having rich cross-referencing into the code is equally important.

With that in mind, this web application provides such a model and will evolve over time to suit my requirements and the needs of my users.

## Usage

Please see the <a href="https://socketry.github.io/utopia-project/">project documentation</a> or run it locally using `bake utopia:project:serve`.
